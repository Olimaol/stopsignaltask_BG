Further reduced Arky-proto1 and proto2-proto1, in go proto2 and arky get very acitve.. better would be consistent active to inhibit proto1 slightly, stopping is very bad now

 Reduce cortexmotorStop strength, deactivate motorStop-Proto1
Increase cortexStop strength

Reduced motorSTOP delay to make gap in gpe smaller

In go Proto2 and Arky get active, Proto1 mainly unchanged… good enough for dodson

Increased go delay to improve stopping

Imporved stopping, but there are late fails… seems that proto2 not always reaches threshold, first increase stop-proto2 and then maybe decrease laterals between proto2 and arky

Only increased stop-proto2, improved stopping, depending on model construction corrext stops between 60-80% and late failed stops are very rare… maybe reduce gpe laterals between proto2 and arky to improve stopping a little bit further

Mean stopping = 68% improve stopping → increase delay_GO by 10ms

Test: decrease laterals between Arky and Proto2,  increase D2 inhibition to Arky and Proto2, increase Arky-Str inhibition

Looks ok, Snr has two peaks → probably rebound after D1 inhibition → lower D1-Snr, increase STN-Snr, lower Snr baseline
Further FSI could get active a bit more → increase FSI inputs

After reducing S1-Snr and increasing STN-Snr second Snr peak significantly lower, but GO takes too long

After equalizing excitatory inputs to FSI with SD1 and SD2 FSI is still less active → furhter reducing Proto1-FSI

Too big difference between SD1 and SD2, SD1 is too active → reducing ED1 and thal-D1

Looks better, now make GO faster again, decrease tau GO, further slightly increase SD1-Snr again

Not better, sometimes GO tries to start but then needs a second try… maybe lower Go-D1 instead of lower Thal-D1

Helps, but only 60-70% stopping and already active Str doesn‘t seem to have an effect on Arky/Proto2 → decrease SD1-Snr again and decrease Stop-Arky/Stop-Proto2

Decreasing SD1-Snr leads again to two activity initiations… again increase it back, decreasing stop input didn‘t change much, further decrease Stop input and decrease Arky-Str

Two initiations still there, equalize D1/D2 GO inputs again

Stop input is not needed in GO trials for stopping, rebound makes it by itself, get str-thalamus loop active-→ increase SD1-Snr again, increase tauGO",,,,

Most likely the biggest problem is that stop input is almost not needed at all because of rebounds… someow change the model so that it stays active

Str-thal loop doesn‘t stay active… this is maybe the reason why stop-Arky has no effect

Try decreasing Str laterals → both more active, not much longer, SD2 is more like SD1

Decreasing somehow SD2 → lower SD2 inputs, decerasing thal feedback worked

Now Stop is not strong enough to activate Gpe → maybe reducing D2 inhibition or increasing Stop input

Increased stop input to arky, arky slighlty responses, further increase Arky-Str inhibitoin and decerase arky baseline, first Arky has to getr more active → stronger stop input
